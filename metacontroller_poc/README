Providing an Operator to create, update and delete a notion of Tenant.
The operator uses concepts of metacontroller and argoworkflows.

Different Custlom Resources created for Create/Update/Delete Tenant operations.
Metacontroller passes the information to corresponding lambda controller which
creates an argo workflow based on templating.

CreateTenant: metacontroller_poc/tenant_create
UpdateTenant: metacontroller_poc/tenant_update
DeleteTenant: metacontroller_poc/tenant_delete


This is the first step in making operations easier to create a tenant with different
Custom resources.

[Ongoing] To have a single Custom Resource which can reference the resources created
by argo workflow.
